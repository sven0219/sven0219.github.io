# Why need PicGo

I have used some Picture bed such as `sm.ms` before, but some are unstable.

so I came up with the idea of building one myself. 

After checking some information, I found that `PicGo + GithHub` can also be implemented. 

This article introduces how to build it.

# Install PicGo

# Configuration

## Create and log in your GitHub account

[Github](https://github.com)

## Create a repo for GitHub Img

Since I built the picture bed mainly for the blog you are currently visiting, so I created a new branch on [sven0219.github.io](https://github.com/sven0219/sven0219.github.io/tree/static_files)

You can also create a new repository.
